NodeBots are robots that are controlled by node.js. A NodeBots event is a full day event where JS developers team up in small teams to program robots with JS.

We’ve got 3 radio-controlled, video-enabled cars which can be controlled with JS over wifi, and also a nodecopter you can fly with JS (or just with your phone)!

We’ll have arduino kits you can use to build and program robots. You don’t need to know what a resistor is or how to use an aynschronous callback, we’ll have hardware and JS experts ready to help you throughout the day.

We’ve also extra sensors and displays you can tinker with. We’ve also got buckets of Lego Technic you can use to build quick prototypes.

You’ll be able to buy Arduino kits at a discount on the day, if you want to take your work home with you (sorry you can’t buy the lego though!)
