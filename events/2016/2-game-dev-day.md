Game Dev Day is a hack day for people to have fun making games and virtual reality experiences in web technologies.

Anyone whose interested in games or VR is welcome. Don't worry if you don't have any experience coding games. People usually organise themselves into teams, work on a project and then demo it at the end of the day, so there's plenty of chances to work with others and learn new skills, as well as use skills you already have, like drawing pictures!

Bring your laptop (and a charger), your smartphone for VR (or to use as a controller!) and if you happen to have a VR headset feel free to bring that too.

Find out more on the Game Dev Day website.
