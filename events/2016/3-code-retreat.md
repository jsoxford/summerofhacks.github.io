A CodeRetreat is a day-long, coding practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. Developers can disconnect from day-to-day constraints, like time and feature pressure, and just focus on the craft of programming. You don't have to ship anything. Just practice.

This event is for anyone who wants to improve their code. An understanding of JavaScript will help you make the most of the day, but you will be guided through the day by a facilitator and will be pairing up with different partners as well, so don't worry about pressure to perform. Whatever your experience, you'll have the opportunity to think about things in new ways and work with new people.

All you need is your lovely self and a laptop (with it's charger).
