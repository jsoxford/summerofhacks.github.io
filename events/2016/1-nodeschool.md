NodeSchool is a collection of workshops that help you learn JavaScript by writing code and solving challenges. The event is for everyone, whether you've never written a line of JavaScript before or you're a pro; NodeSchool has challenges and activities for all different levels.

Bring your laptop (and a charger), there'll be mentors and chances to pair with other attendees. Youâ€™ll need Node.js on your computer to get started, and if you have a chance to [install it](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) before the event you'll be able to get started straight away.
