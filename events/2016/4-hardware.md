This is a day of hacking on hardware. It's for anyone who is interested in learning about hardware and there is no minimum entry requirememts, other than an equisitive mind.

If you've never touched a breadboard before, that's fine – We’re bringing some starter packs, complete with Espruino boards and components and plenty of helpful people to guide you. If you're a bit more experienced that's great too, as you'll get to play with some new kit or hack on a project with like-minded people.

You'll probably want to being a laptop (and it's charger) and you're welcome to bring any other tools and components you have. We'd recommend marking them up somehow so it's easy to check you're taking the right things home.
