# Contributing

The Summer of Hacks is entirely volunteer-run and is all about the community, so thanks for helping! :clap: :clap: :clap:

If you're unsure of anything, have a question or want to find anything out, (come chat with us on Gitter)[https://gitter.im/summerofhacks/summerofhacks.github.io].

## Issues

* Issues are appropriate for questions, talk ideas, requests for help, pretty much anything.

## Pull Requests

* For general tweaks and improvements to the site, please submit a pull request from your fork to the `develop` branch. For more substantial changes, contentious issues or changes to be released later please submit a pull request to a feature branch (e.g. `feature/adds_unicorns`).
* Ensure any code or content you're submitting can be released under our [license](https://github.com/jsoxford/jsoxford.github.com/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

## Branches

This project uses a modified version of the [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) branching strategy.

* `master` holds the deployed site. There's no source-code there!
* `develop` contains the latest released source. This branch is built and deployed to master on every commit. No commits should ever be made to `develop` directly, instead use a feature branch/forked repository and a pull request.
* Feature branches (prefixed `feature/`) are used to hold changes in development or up for discussion.
